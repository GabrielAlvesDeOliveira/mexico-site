<div className=\"texto\"> Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Aztec peoples, Toltec and Mayan already occupied the territory today known as Mexico, besides that, these peoples built observatories, developed a calendar with 365 days, built aqueducts, used hieroglyphs to write, and knew algebra and math.<br/>\r\n            <br/>In 1519, the Spanish conquer Hernán Cortés invaded the actual territory of Mexico and destroyed the Aztec empire between 1519 and 1521. When the Spanish arrived the Aztecs considered them their liberators, the Aztec king himself considered Hernán Cortés the god Quetzalcoatl (god of contributed to the creation of humanity according to Aztec mythology). Because of that and for the dissatisfaction with the government, a lot of Aztecs allied with the Spanish.<br/>\r\n             <br/>In the ruins of the capital of the Aztec empire was built the actual Mexico capital, Mexico City. In 1524, with a Spanish military, came also missionaries (Franciscan friars) who converted the indigenous to the Catholic religion.<br/>\r\n             <br/>Between 1846 and 1848, there was a war against the United States, known as the Mexico War. That war ended with Mexico signing a peace agreement known as the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. This treaty resulted in the Mexican loss of several territories in the north of the country, that today are known as New Mexico, Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, and West of Colorado.<br/>\r\n             <br/>In 1876, the government of Porfirio Díaz has implanted a dictatorship that lasted 31 years. How the elections were considered fraudulent, the population rebelled, and thus, in 1910, the Mexican Revolution began.<br/>\r\n             <br/>The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) dominated Mexican politics between 1929 and 2000 until Vicente Fox Quesada was elected by the National Action Party of Mexico. Mexico passed for an economic crisis in 1994, due to the lack of competitiveness of the Mexican companies in the face of the installation of US companies, belonging to NAFTA(North American Free Trade Agreement), in the country. Despite these difficulties, Mexico was the fastest-growing country in Latin America in the late 1990s.\r\n             </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport default
